COPY public.exercises (id, name, type, muscle, equipment, difficulty, instructions) FROM stdin;
1	Landmine twist	strength	abdominals	other	intermediate	Position a bar into a landmine or securely anchor it in a corner. Load the bar to an appropriate weight. Raise the bar from the floor, taking it to shoulder height with both hands with your arms extended in front of you. Adopt a wide stance. This will be your starting position. Perform the movement by rotating the trunk and hips as you swing the weight all the way down to one side. Keep your arms extended throughout the exercise. Reverse the motion to swing the weight all the way to the opposite side. Continue alternating the movement until the set is complete.
2	Elbow plank	strength	abdominals	body_only	intermediate	Get into a prone position on the floor, supporting your weight on your toes and your forearms. Your arms are bent and directly below the shoulder. Keep your body straight at all times, and hold this position as long as possible. To increase difficulty, an arm or leg can be raised.
3	Bottoms Up	strength	abdominals	body_only	intermediate	Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms at your side. This will be your starting position. To perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest by flexing the hips and knees. Following this, extend your legs directly above you so that they are perpendicular to the ground. Rotate and elevate your pelvis to raise your glutes from the floor. After a brief pause, return to the starting position.
4	Suspended ab fall-out	strength	abdominals	other	intermediate	Adjust the straps so the handles are at an appropriate height, below waist level. Begin standing and grasping the handles. Lean into the straps, moving to an incline push-up position. This will be your starting position. Keeping your arms straight, lean further into the suspension straps, bringing your body closer to the ground, allowing your shoulders to extend, raising your arms up and over your head. Maintain a neutral spine and keep the rest of your body straight, your shoulders being the only joints allowed to move. Pause during the peak contraction, and then return to the starting position.
5	Dumbbell V-Sit Cross Jab	strength	abdominals	dumbbell	intermediate	Begin seated on your butt with your knees bent and feet on the ground. Lean your upper body back to form a 45-degree angle with the floor. Bring your feet off the ground so that your body resembles a "V" shape. Grasp a dumbbell in each hand and hold tight to your chest with palms facing each other. This will be your starting position. While keeping your core tight and maintaining your body's "V" position, quickly extend your left arm straight out (similar to a jab) and then bring it back to the starting position while simultaneously punching out with the right arm. Your torso and legs may slightly rotate side to side opposite of your hands throughout the movementâ€”this is okay. A punch with each hand counts as one total repetition. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.
6	Standing cable low-to-high twist	strength	abdominals	cable	intermediate	Connect a standard handle on a tower, and move the cable to the lowest pulley position. With your side to the cable, grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately armâ€™s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable. Your outstretched arm should be aligned with the cable. With your feet positioned shoulder width apart, squat down and grab the handle with both hands. Your arms should still be fully extended. In one motion, pull the handle up and across your body until your arms are in a fully-extended position above your head. Keep your back straight and your arms close to your body as you pivot your back foot and straighten your legs to get a full range of motion. Retract your arms and then your body. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner. Repeat to failure. Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.  Tip: You will twist your entire body with this exercise, but focus on getting maximal torso rotation and a strong clinch at the end of the movement. To ensure a good mind-muscle connection, keep your abs tense at all times.
7	Dumbbell spell caster	strength	abdominals	dumbbell	beginner	Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated grip. Your feet should be wide with your hips and knees extended. This will be your starting position. Begin the movement by pulling both of the dumbbells to one side next to your hip, rotating your torso. Keeping your arms straight and the dumbbells parallel to the ground, rotate your torso to swing the weights to your opposite side. Continue alternating, rotating from one side to the other until the set is complete.
8	Decline reverse crunch	strength	abdominals	other	intermediate	Lie on your back on a decline bench and hold on to the top of the bench with both hands. Don't let your body slip down from this position. Hold your legs parallel to the floor using your abs to hold them there while keeping your knees and feet together. Tip: Your legs should be fully extended with a slight bend on the knee. This will be your starting position. While exhaling, move your legs towards the torso as you roll your pelvis backwards and you raise your hips off the bench. At the end of this movement your knees will be touching your chest. Hold the contraction for a second and move your legs back to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can do the movement on a flat surface and as you get more advanced you can use ankle weights.
9	Spider crawl	strength	abdominals	body_only	intermediate	Begin in a prone position on the floor. Support your weight on your hands and toes, with your feet together and your body straight. Your arms should be bent to 90 degrees. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by raising one foot off of the ground. Externally rotate the leg and bring the knee toward your elbow, as far forward as possible. Return this leg to the starting position and repeat on the opposite side.
10	Cocoons	strength	abdominals	body_only	intermediate	Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms extended behind your head. This will be your starting position. To perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest, rotating your pelvis to lift your glutes from the floor. As you do so, flex the spine, bringing your arms back over your head to perform a simultaneous crunch motion. After a brief pause, return to the starting position.
11	Hip Circles (Prone)	stretching	abductors	None	intermediate	Position yourself on your hands and knees on the ground. Maintaining good posture, raise one bent knee off of the ground. This will be your starting position. Keeping the knee in a bent position, rotate the femur in an arc, attempting to make a big circle with your knee. Perform this slowly for a number of repetitions, and repeat on the other side.
12	Standing Hip Circles	stretching	abductors	body_only	beginner	Begin standing on one leg, holding to a vertical support. Raise the unsupported knee to 90 degrees. This will be your starting position. Open the hip as far as possible, attempting to make a big circle with your knee. Perform this movement slowly for a number of repetitions, and repeat on the other side.
13	Clam	strength	abductors	None	intermediate	Begin by lying on your side on the ground. Support your head on your left arm. Flex the hips to 45 degrees and the knees to approximately 90 degrees, with your right leg directly on top of your left. This will be your starting position. Initiate the exercise by abducting your right leg, pushing your knee away from the midline of your body. Maintain contact between your feet throughout the movement. Pause at the top of the motion, and then return to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. Do both sides.
14	Iliotibial band SMR	stretching	abductors	foam_roll	intermediate	Lay on your side, with the bottom leg placed onto a foam roller between the hip and the knee. The other leg can be crossed in front of you. Place as much of your weight as is tolerable onto your bottom leg; there is no need to keep your bottom leg in contact with the ground. Be sure to relax the muscles of the leg you are stretching. Roll your leg over the foam from you hip to your knee, pausing for 10-30 seconds at points of tension. Repeat with the opposite leg.
15	Thigh abductor	strength	abductors	machine	intermediate	To begin, sit down on the abductor machine and select a weight you are comfortable with. When your legs are positioned properly, grip the handles on each side. Your entire upper body (from the waist up) should be stationary. This is the starting position. Slowly press against the machine with your legs to move them away from each other while exhaling. Feel the contraction for a second and begin to move your legs back to the starting position while breathing in. Note: Remember to keep your upper body stationary to prevent any injuries from occurring. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
16	Fire Hydrant	strength	abductors	body_only	beginner	Position yourself on your hands and knees on the ground. This will be your starting position. Keeping the knee in a bent position, abduct the femur, moving your knee away from the midline of the body. Pause at the top of the motion, and then slowly return to the starting position. Perform this slowly for a number of repetitions, and repeat on the other side.
17	Windmills	stretching	abductors	body_only	intermediate	Lie on your back with your arms extended out to the sides and your legs straight. This will be your starting position. Lift one leg and quickly cross it over your body, attempting to touch the ground near the opposite hand. Return to the starting position, and repeat with the opposite leg. Continue to alternate for 10-20 repetitions.
18	Monster Walk	strength	abductors	body_only	intermediate	Place a band around both ankles and another around both knees. There should be enough tension that they are tight when your feet are shoulder width apart. To begin, take short steps forward alternating your left and right foot. After several steps, do just the opposite and walk backward to where you started.
19	IT Band and Glute Stretch	stretching	abductors	body_only	intermediate	Loop a belt, rope, or band around one of your feet, and swing that leg across your body to the opposite side, keeping the leg extended as you lay on the ground. This will be your starting position. Keeping your foot off of the floor, pull on the belt, using the tension to pull the toes up. Hold for 10-20 seconds, and repeat on the other side.
20	Single-leg lying cross-over stretch	stretching	abductors	body_only	beginner	Lie on your back with your legs extended. Cross one leg over your body with the knee bent, attempting to touch the knee to the ground. Your partner should kneel beside you, holding your shoulder down with one hand and controlling the crossed leg with the other. this will be your starting position. Attempt to raise the bent knee off of the ground as your partner prevents any actual movement. After 10-20 seconds, relax the leg as your partner gently presses the knee towards the floor. Repeat with the other side.

Rest your head on your right hand or shoulder. Lift your left leg upward and hold it by the back of the knee (easier) or the foot (harder). Pull your left knee in toward your left shoulder and simultaneously press your foot or knee down to the floor. To intensify this stretch, straighten your left leg. Switch sides.
29	Adductor/Groin	stretching	adductors	none	beginner	Lie on your back with your feet raised towards the ceiling. Have your partner hold your feet or ankles. Abduct your legs as far as you can. This will be your starting position. Attempt to squeeze your legs together for 10 or more seconds, while your partner prevents you from doing so. Now, relax the muscles in your legs as your partner pushes your feet apart, stretching as far as is comfortable for you. Be sure to let your partner know when the stretch is adequate to prevent overstretching or injury.
30	Lying Bent Leg Groin	stretching	adductors	other	beginner	Lie on your back with your knees bent and the soles of the feet pressed together. Have your partner hold your knees. This will be your starting position. Attempt to squeeze your knees together, while your partner prevents any movement from occurring. After 10-20 seconds, relax your muscles as your partner gently pushes your knees towards the floor. Be sure to inform your helper when the stretch is adequate to prevent injury or overstretching.
31	Incline Hammer Curls	strength	biceps	dumbbell	beginner	Seat yourself on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand. You should pressed firmly against he back with your feet together. Allow the dumbbells to hang straight down at your side, holding them with a neutral grip. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by flexing at the elbow, attempting to keep the upper arm stationary. Continue to the top of the movement and pause, then slowly return to the start position.
32	Wide-grip barbell curl	strength	biceps	barbell	beginner	Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at the wide outer handle. The palm of your hands should be facing forward. The elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard. Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  You can also perform this movement using an E-Z bar or E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement. You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.
33	EZ-bar spider curl	strength	biceps	barbell	intermediate	Start out by setting the bar on the part of the preacher bench that you would normally sit on. Make sure to align the barbell properly so that it is balanced and will not fall off. Move to the front side of the preacher bench (the part where the arms usually lay) and position yourself to lay at a 45 degree slant with your torso and stomach pressed against the front side of the preacher bench. Make sure that your feet (especially the toes) are well positioned on the floor and place your upper arms on top of the pad located on the inside part of the preacher bench. Use your arms to grab the barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up) at about shoulder width apart or slightly closer from each other. Slowly begin to lift the barbell upwards and exhale. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Slowly begin to bring the barbell back to the starting position as your breathe in. . Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: You can also use dumbbells when performing this exercise. Just make sure you place the dumbbells on the part of the preacher bench where you would normally sit properly.
34	Hammer Curls	strength	biceps	dumbbell	intermediate	Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso. The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. Now, while holding your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight forward while contracting the biceps. Continue to raise the weight until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Focus on keeping the elbow stationary and only moving your forearm. After the brief pause, inhale and slowly begin the lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.
35	EZ-Bar Curl	strength	biceps	e-z_curl_bar	intermediate	Stand up straight while holding an EZ curl bar at the wide outer handle. The palms of your hands should be facing forward and slightly tilted inward due to the shape of the bar. Keep your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position. Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps. Focus on only moving your forearms. Continue to raise the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the top contracted position for a moment and squeeze the biceps. Then inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement. You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.
36	Zottman Curl	strength	biceps	None	intermediate	Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso. Make sure the palms of the hands are facing each other. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Your wrist should rotate so that you have a supinated (palms up) grip. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Now during the contracted position, rotate your wrist until you now have a pronated (palms facing down) grip with the thumb at a higher position than the pinky. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back down using the pronated grip. As the dumbbells close your thighs, start rotating the wrist so that you go back to a neutral (palms facing your body) grip. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
37	Biceps curl to shoulder press	strength	biceps	dumbbell	beginner	Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be hanging at your sides with your palms facing forward. Look directly ahead, keeping your chest up, with your feet shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows to curl the weight. Do not use momentum or flex through the shoulder, instead use a controlled motion. Execute the pressing movement by extending the arm, flexing and abducting the shoulder to rotate the arm as you press above your head. Pause at the top of the motion before reversing the movement to return to the starting position. Complete the desired number of repetitions before switching to the opposite side.
38	Barbell Curl	strength	biceps	barbell	intermediate	Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at a shoulder-width grip. The palm of your hands should be facing forward and the elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard. Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  You can also perform this movement using a straight bar attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement. You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.
39	Concentration curl	strength	biceps	dumbbell	intermediate	Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor. Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh. Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Caution: Avoid swinging motions at any time. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then repeat the movement with the left arm.  Variations: This exercise can be performed standing with the torso bent forward and the arm in front of you. In this case, no leg support is used for the back of your arm so you will need to make extra effort to ensure no movement of the upper arm. This is a more challenging version of the exercise and is not recommended for people with lower back issues.
40	Flexor Incline Dumbbell Curls	strength	biceps	dumbbell	beginner	Hold the dumbbell towards the side farther from you so that you have more weight on the side closest to you. (This can be done for a good effect on all bicep dumbbell exercises). Now do a normal incline dumbbell curl, but keep your wrists as far back as possible so as to neutralize any stress that is placed on them. Sit on an incline bench that is angled at 45-degrees while holding a dumbbell on each hand. Let your arms hang down on your sides, with the elbows in, and turn the palms of your hands forward with the thumbs pointing away from the body. Tip: You will keep this hand position throughout the movement as there should not be any twisting of the hands as they come up. This will be your starting position. Curl up the two dumbbells at the same time until your biceps are fully contracted and exhale. Tip: Do not swing the arms or use momentum. Keep a controlled motion at all times. Hold the contracted position for a second at the top. As you inhale, slowly go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Do not extend your arms totally as you could injure your elbows if you hyperextend them. Also, make sure that on the way down you move slowly to avoid injury. Variations: You can use cables for this movement as well.
41	Smith Machine Calf Raise	strength	calves	machine	intermediate	Place a block or weight plate below the bar on the Smith machine. Set the bar to a position that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step onto the plates with the balls of your feet and place the bar on the back of your shoulders. Take the bar with both hands facing forward. Rotate the bar to unrack it. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as high as possible by pushing off of the balls of your feet, flexing your calf at the top of the contraction. Your knees should remain extended. Hold the contracted position for a second before you start to go back down. Return slowly to the starting position as you breathe in while lowering your heels. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
42	Standing Calf Raises	strength	calves	machine	beginner	Adjust the padded lever of the calf raise machine to fit your height. Place your shoulders under the pads provided and position your toes facing forward (or using any of the two other positions described at the beginning of the chapter). The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the calf block with the heels extending off it. Push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Variations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A barbell instead of a machine can be used instead as well as dumbbells, one leg or two legs at a time. Refer to the exercise descriptions of these movements below. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well.
56	Low-cable cross-over	strength	chest	cable	intermediate	To move into the starting position, place the pulleys at the low position, select the resistance to be used and grasp a handle in each hand. Step forward, gaining tension in the pulleys. Your palms should be facing forward, hands below the waist, and your arms straight. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend in your arms, draw your hands upward and toward the midline of your body. Your hands should come together in front of your chest, palms facing up. Return your arms back to the starting position after a brief pause.
43	Seated Calf Raise	strength	calves	machine	intermediate	Sit on the machine and place your toes on the lower portion of the platform provided with the heels extending off. Choose the toe positioning of your choice (forward, in, or out) as per the beginning of this chapter. Place your lower thighs under the lever pad, which will need to be adjusted according to the height of your thighs. Now place your hands on top of the lever pad in order to prevent it from slipping forward. Lift the lever slightly by pushing your heels up and release the safety bar. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower your heels by bending at the ankles until the calves are fully stretched. Inhale as you perform this movement. Raise the heels by extending the ankles as high as possible as you contract the calves and breathe out. Hold the top contraction for a second. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
44	Calf Press On The Leg Press Machine	strength	calves	machine	intermediate	Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you without locking your knees. (Note: In some leg press units you can leave the safety bars on for increased safety. If your leg press unit allows for this, then this is the preferred method of performing the exercise.) Your torso and the legs should make perfect 90-degree angle. Now carefully place your toes and balls of your feet on the lower portion of the platform with the heels extending off. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position. Press on the platform by raising your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Be very cautious as you place the feet in the bottom part of the platform as if you slip and the safety bars are not locked then you could suffer a serious accident. Variations: You can perform this exercise one leg at a time.
45	Rocking Standing Calf Raise	strength	calves	barbell	beginner	This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place it on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck). Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance. Also maintain a straight back and keep the knees with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending (other than the slight initial bend we created during positioning) at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Now lift your toes by contracting the tibia muscles in the front of the calves as you breathe out. Hold for a second and bring them back down as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Also, choose a conservative weight. This exercise requires a lot of balance and choosing too much weight may cause you to lose balance and fall. Variations: A smith machine can be used for this exercise as well and it is a better choice for those with poor balance. Dumbbells can be used also.
46	Calf Press	strength	calves	machine	beginner	Adjust the seat so that your legs are only slightly bent in the start position. The balls of your feet should be firmly on the platform. Select an appropriate weight, and grasp the handles. This will be your starting position. Straighten the legs by extending the knees, just barely lifting the weight from the stack. Your ankle should be fully flexed, toes pointing up. Execute the movement by pressing downward through the balls of your feet as far as possible. After a brief pause, reverse the motion and repeat.
47	Standing barbell calf raise	strength	calves	barbell	beginner	This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the bar on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck). Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Variations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A calf press machine instead of a squat rack can be used as well as dumbbells with one leg or two legs at a time. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well. You can also perform the barbell calf raise using a piece of wood to place the ball of the foot. This will allow you to get a better range of motion. However be cautious as in this case you will need to balance yourself much better.
48	Barbell Seated Calf Raise	strength	calves	barbell	beginner	Place a block about 12 inches in front of a flat bench. Sit on the bench and place the ball of your feet on the block. Have someone place a barbell over your upper thighs about 3 inches above your knees and hold it there. This will be your starting position. Raise up on your toes as high as possible as you squeeze the calves and as you breathe out. After a second contraction, slowly go back to the starting position. Tip: To get maximum benefit stretch your calves as far as you can. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can use the smith machine or the seated calf raise machine in order to perform this exercise. Alternatively, you can also use dumbbells by placing one on top of each thigh.
49	Balance Board	strength	calves	other	beginner	Note: This exercise is designed to increase balance.  Place a balance board in front of you. Stand up on it and try to balance yourself. Hold the balance for as long as desired.  Caution: If your balance is poor, start out with one of the less challenging boards. Variations: You can perform this exercise using various types of balance boards. Some are more challenging than others.
50	Weighted donkey calf raise	strength	calves	other	intermediate	For this exercise you will need access to a donkey calf raise machine. Start by positioning your lower back and hips under the padded lever provided. The tailbone area should be the one making contact with the pad. Place both of your arms on the side handles and place the balls of your feet on the calf block with the heels extending off. Align the toes forward, inward or outward, depending on the area you wish to target, and straighten the knees without locking them. This will be your starting position. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: If you don't have a machine available but have access to a calf block and a sturdy object to hold on to, you can perform this using as resistance a person sitting on your lower back (around the tailbone area).
51	Dumbbell Bench Press	strength	chest	dumbbell	intermediate	Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position. Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.  Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor. Variations: Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other. Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.
52	Pushups	strength	chest	body_only	intermediate	Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length. Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest. After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as needed.  Variations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor. For the most advanced lifters, you can place your feet at a high surface such as a bench in order to increase the resistance and to target the upper chest more.
53	Close-grip bench press	strength	chest	barbell	intermediate	Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position. As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement. After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.  Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else. Variations: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells, in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other.
54	Dumbbell Flyes	strength	chest	dumbbell	intermediate	Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.
55	Incline dumbbell bench press	strength	chest	dumbbell	intermediate	Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width. Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position. Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push the dumbbells up with your chest. Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells.  Variations: You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you are using is adjustable. Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other. Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.
57	Barbell Bench Press - Medium Grip	strength	chest	barbell	intermediate	Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position. From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest. After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.  Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your middle chest and nowhere else. Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.
58	Chest dip	strength	chest	other	intermediate	For this exercise you will need access to parallel bars. To get yourself into the starting position, hold your body at arms length (arms locked) above the bars. While breathing in, lower yourself slowly with your torso leaning forward around 30 degrees or so and your elbows flared out slightly until you feel a slight stretch in the chest. Once you feel the stretch, use your chest to bring your body back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Remember to squeeze the chest at the top of the movement for a second. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.
59	Decline Dumbbell Flyes	strength	chest	dumbbell	intermediate	Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width. The palms of the hands should be facing each other and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor and fully extended. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variation: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.
60	Bodyweight Flyes	strength	chest	e-z_curl_bar	beginner	Position two equally loaded EZ bars on the ground next to each other. Ensure they are able to roll. Assume a push-up position over the bars, supporting your weight on your toes and hands with your arms extended and body straight. Place your hands on the bars. This will be your starting position. Using a slow and controlled motion, move your hands away from the midline of your body, rolling the bars apart. Inhale during this portion of the motion. After moving the bars as far apart as you can, return to the starting position by pulling them back together. Exhale as you perform this movement.
61	Rickshaw Carry	strongman	forearms	other	beginner	Position the frame at the starting point, and load with the appropriate weight. Standing in the center of the frame, begin by gripping the handles and driving through your heels to lift the frame. Ensure your chest and head are up and your back is straight.

Bring the frame to the ground after you have reached the end point.
62	Palms-down wrist curl over bench	strength	forearms	barbell	intermediate	Start out by placing a barbell on one side of a flat bench. Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench. Use your arms to grab the barbell with a pronated grip (palms down) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge. Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling. Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed. You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell.
63	Straight-bar wrist roll-up	strength	forearms	None	intermediate	Hold a barbell with both hands and your palms facing down; hands spaced about shoulder width. This will be your starting position. Alternating between each of your hands, perform the movement by extending the wrist as though you were rolling up a newspaper. Continue alternating back and forth until failure. Reverse the motion by flexing the wrist, rolling the opposite direction. Continue the alternating motion until failure.
64	Dumbbell farmer's walk	strongman	forearms	other	intermediate	There are various implements that can be used for the farmers walk. These can also be performed with heavy dumbbells or short bars if these implements aren't available. Begin by standing between the implements. After gripping the handles, lift them up by driving through your heels, keeping your back straight and your head up. Walk taking short, quick steps, and don't forget to breathe. Move for a given distance, typically 50-100 feet, as fast as possible.
65	Palms-up wrist curl over bench	strength	forearms	barbell	intermediate	Start out by placing a barbell on one side of a flat bench. Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench. Use your arms to grab the barbell with a supinated grip (palms up) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge. Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling. Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed. You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell.
66	Standing behind-the-back wrist curl	strength	forearms	barbell	beginner	Start by standing straight and holding a barbell behind your glutes at arm's length while using a pronated grip (palms will be facing back away from the glutes) and having your hands shoulder width apart from each other. You should be looking straight forward while your feet are shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position. While exhaling, slowly elevate the barbell up by curling your wrist in a semi-circular motion towards the ceiling. Note: Your wrist should be the only body part moving for this exercise. Hold the contraction for a second and lower the barbell back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. When finished, lower the barbell down to the squat rack or the floor by bending the knees. Tip: It is easiest to either pick it up from a squat rack or have a partner hand it to you.  Variations: You can also perform this exercise with dumbbells using the same movements as described above. Another option is to use one dumbbell at a time for better isolation.
67	Seated finger curl	strength	forearms	barbell	beginner	Hold a barbell with both hands and your palms facing up; hands spaced about shoulder width. Place your feet flat on the floor, at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position. Lower the bar as far as possible by extending the fingers. Allowing the bar to roll down the hands, catch the bar with the final joint in the fingers. Now curl bar up as high as possible by closing your hands while exhaling. Hold the contraction at the top.
68	Seated Two-Arm Palms-Up Low-Pulley Wrist Curl	strength	forearms	cable	beginner	Put a bench in front of a low pulley machine that has a barbell or EZ Curl attachment on it. Move the bench far enough away so that when you bring the handle to the top of your thighs tension is created on the cable due to the weight stack being moved up. Now hold the handle with both hands, palms up, using a shoulder-width grip. Step back and sit on the bench with your feet about shoulder width apart, firmly on the floor. Lean forward and place the forearms on your thighs with the back of your wrists over your knees. This will be your starting position. Lower the bar as far as possible, while inhaling and keeping a tight grip. Now curl the bar up as high as possible while contracting the forearms. Tip: Only the wrist should move; not the forearms. After a second contraction at the top go back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: This exercise can be performed also with a single handle attachment (one arm at a time) or with free weights (barbells or dumbbells) using one arm and two arm variations.
69	Wrist Roller	strength	forearms	other	beginner	To begin, stand straight up grabbing a wrist roller using a pronated grip (palms facing down). Your feet should be shoulder width apart. Slowly lift both arms until they are fully extended and parallel to the floor in front of you. Note: Make sure the rope is not wrapped around the roller. Your entire body should be stationary except for the forearms. This is the starting position. Rotate one wrist at a time in an upward motion to bring the weight up to the bar by rolling the rope around the roller. Once the weight has reached the bar, slowly begin to lower the weight back down by rotating the wrist in a downward motion until the weight reaches the starting position. Repeat for the prescribed amount of repetitions in your program.
70	Seated One-Arm Dumbbell Palms-Up Wrist Curl	strength	forearms	dumbbell	beginner	Sit on a flat bench with a dumbbell in your right hand. Place your feet flat on the floor, at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Lean forward and place your right forearm on top of your upper right thigh with your palm up. Tip: Make sure that the front of the wrist lies on top of your knees. This will be your starting position. Lower the dumbbell as far as possible as you keep a tight grip on the dumbbell. Inhale as you perform this movement. Now curl the dumbbell as high as possible as you contract the forearms and as you exhale. Keep the contraction for a second before you lower again. Tip: The only movement should happen at the wrist. Perform for the recommended amount of repetitions, switch arms and repeat the movement.  Variations: You can also do this movement with two arms at a time, one on each knee, or using a barbell.
71	Barbell glute bridge	powerlifting	glutes	barbell	intermediate	Begin seated on the ground with a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lay down flat on the floor. Begin the movement by driving through with your heels, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your upper back and the heels of your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position.
72	Barbell Hip Thrust	powerlifting	glutes	barbell	intermediate	Begin seated on the ground with a bench directly behind you. Have a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lean back against the bench so that your shoulder blades are near the top of it. Begin the movement by driving through your feet, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your shoulder blades and your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position.
73	Single-leg cable hip extension	strength	glutes	cable	intermediate	Hook a leather ankle cuff to a low cable pulley and then attach the cuff to your ankle. Face the weight stack from a distance of about two feet, grasping the steel frame for support. While keeping your knees and hips bent slightly and your abs tight, contract your glutes to slowly "kick" the working leg back in a semicircular arc as high as it will comfortably go as you breathe out. Tip: At full extension, squeeze your glutes for a second in order to achieve a peak contraction. Now slowly bring your working leg forward, resisting the pull of the cable until you reach the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch legs and repeat the movement for the other side.  Variations: You can perform this exercise with exercise bands.
74	Glute bridge	strength	glutes	body_only	intermediate	Lie flat on the floor on your back with the hands by your side and your knees bent. Your feet should be placed around shoulder width. This will be your starting position. Pushing mainly with your heels, lift your hips off the floor while keeping your back straight. Breathe out as you perform this part of the motion and hold at the top for a second. Slowly go back to the starting position as you breathe in.  Variations: You can perform this exercise one leg at a time.
75	Single-leg glute bridge	strength	glutes	body_only	intermediate	Lay on the floor with your feet flat and knees bent. Raise one leg off of the ground, pulling the knee to your chest. This will be your starting position. Execute the movement by driving through the heel, extending your hip upward and raising your glutes off of the ground. Extend as far as possible, pause and then return to the starting position.
76	Step-up with knee raise	strength	glutes	body_only	intermediate	Stand facing a box or bench of an appropriate height with your feet together. This will be your starting position. Begin the movement by stepping up, putting your left foot on the top of the bench. Extend through the hip and knee of your front leg to stand up on the box. As you stand on the box with your left leg, flex your right knee and hip, bringing your knee as high as you can. Reverse this motion to step down off the box, and then repeat the sequence on the opposite leg.
77	Kettlebell thruster	strength	glutes	kettlebells	intermediate	Clean two kettlebells to your shoulders. Clean the kettlebells to your shoulders by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebells towards your shoulders. Rotate your wrists as you do so. This will be your starting position. Begin to squat by flexing your hips and knees, lowering your hips between your legs. Maintain an upright, straight back as you descend as low as you can. At the bottom, reverse direction and squat by extending your knees and hips, driving through your heels. As you do so, press both kettlebells overhead by extending your arms straight up, using the momentum from the squat to help drive the weights upward. As you begin the next repetition, return the weights to the shoulders.
78	Kneeling Squat	powerlifting	glutes	barbell	beginner	Set the bar to the proper height in a power rack. Kneel behind the bar; it may be beneficial to put a mat down to pad your knees. Slide under the bar, racking it across the back of your shoulders. Your shoulder blades should be retracted and the bar tight across your back. Unrack the weight. With your head looking forward, sit back with your butt until you touch your calves. Reverse the motion, returning the torso to an upright position.
79	Flutter Kicks	strength	glutes	None	intermediate	On a flat bench lie facedown with the hips on the edge of the bench, the legs straight with toes high off the floor and with the arms on top of the bench holding on to the front edge. Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings and straighten the legs until they are level with the hips. This will be your starting position. Start the movement by lifting the left leg higher than the right leg. Then lower the left leg as you lift the right leg. Continue alternating in this manner (as though you are doing a flutter kick in water) until you have done the recommended amount of repetitions for each leg. Make sure that you keep a controlled movement at all times. Tip: You will breathe normally as you perform this movement.  Variations: As you get more advanced you can use ankle weights.
80	Glute Kickback	strength	glutes	body_only	beginner	Kneel on the floor or an exercise mat and bend at the waist with your arms extended in front of you (perpendicular to the torso) in order to get into a kneeling push-up position but with the arms spaced at shoulder width. Your head should be looking forward and the bend of the knees should create a 90-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves. This will be your starting position. As you exhale, lift up your right leg until the hamstrings are in line with the back while maintaining the 90-degree angle bend. Contract the glutes throughout this movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: At the end of the movement the upper leg should be parallel to the floor while the calf should be perpendicular to it. Go back to the initial position as you inhale and now repeat with the left leg. Continue to alternate legs until all of the recommended repetitions have been performed.  Variations: For this exercise you can also perform all of the repetitions with one leg first and then the other one. Additionally, you can also add ankle weights.
81	Barbell Deadlift	strength	hamstrings	barbell	intermediate	Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. Your feet should be about hip-width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder-width allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an alternating grip. With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head. Keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.
82	Romanian Deadlift With Dumbbells	strength	hamstrings	dumbbell	beginner	Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels. Drive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise. When your hips cannot perform any further backward movement, pause, and then slowly return to the starting position by extending the hips.
83	Clean Deadlift	olympic_weightlifting	hamstrings	barbell	beginner	Begin standing with a barbell close to your shins. Your feet should be directly under your hips with your feet turned out slightly. Grip the bar with a double overhand grip or hook grip, about shoulder width apart. Squat down to the bar. Your spine should be in full extension, with a back angle that places your shoulders in front of the bar and your back as vertical as possible. Begin by driving through the floor through the front of your heels. As the bar travels upward, maintain a constant back angle. Flare your knees out to the side to help keep them out of the bar's path. After the bar crosses the knees, complete the lift by driving the hips into the bar until your hips and knees are extended.
84	Sumo deadlift	powerlifting	hamstrings	barbell	beginner	Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms. Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees. As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together. Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down.
85	Romanian Deadlift from Deficit	olympic_weightlifting	hamstrings	barbell	beginner	Begin standing while holding a bar at armâ€™s length in front of you. You can stand on a raised platform to increase the range of motion. Begin by flexing the knees slightly, and then flex at the hip, moving your butt back as far as possible, lowering the torso as far as flexibility allows. The back should remain in absolute extension at all times, and the bar should remain in contact with the legs. If done properly, there should be heavy tension felt in the hamstrings. Reverse the motion to return to the starting position.
86	Power Snatch	olympic_weightlifting	hamstrings	barbell	beginner	Begin with a loaded barbell on the floor. The bar should be close to or touching the shins, and a wide grip should be taken on the bar. The feet should be directly below the hips, with the feet turned out as needed. Lower the hips, with the chest up and the head looking forward. The shoulders should be just in front of the bar. This will be the starting position. Begin the first pull by driving through the front of the heels, raising the bar from the ground. The back angle should stay the same until the bar passes the knees. Transition into the second pull by extending through the hips knees and ankles, driving the bar up as quickly as possible. The bar should be close to the body. At peak extension, shrug the shoulders and allow the elbows to flex to the side. As you move your feet into the receiving position, a slightly wider position, pull yourself below the bar as you elevate the bar overhead. The bar should be received in a partial squat. Continue raising the bar to the overhead position, receiving the bar locked out overhead. Return to a standing position with the weight over head.
87	Power Clean from Blocks	olympic_weightlifting	hamstrings	barbell	beginner	With a barbell on boxes of the desired height, take a grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position. Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, pull yourself under the bar far enough that it can be racked onto the shoulders, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position, and complete the repetition by returning the weight to the boxes.
88	Natural Glute Ham Raise	strength	hamstrings	body_only	beginner	Using the leg pad of a lat pulldown machine or a preacher bench, position yourself so that your ankles are under the pads, knees on the seat, and you are facing away from the machine. You should be upright and maintaining good posture. This will be your starting position. Lower yourself under control until your knees are almost completely straight. Remaining in control, raise yourself back up to the starting position. If you are unable to complete a rep, use a band, a partner, or push off of a box to aid in completing a repetition.
89	Glute ham raise-	strength	hamstrings	none	beginner	You can use a partner for this exercise or brace your feet under something stable. Begin on your knees with your upper legs and torso upright. If using a partner, they will firmly hold your feet to keep you in position. This will be your starting position. Lower yourself by extending at the knee, taking care to NOT flex the hips as you go forward. Place your hands in front of you as you reach the floor. This movement is very difficult and you may be unable to do it unaided. Use your arms to lightly push off the floor to aid your return to the starting position.
90	Snatch Deadlift	olympic_weightlifting	hamstrings	barbell	beginner	The snatch deadlift strengthens the first pull of the snatch. Begin with a wide snatch grip with the barbell placed on the platform. The feet should be directly under the hips, with the feet turned out. Squat down to the bar, keeping the back in absolute extension with the head facing forward. Initiate the movement by driving through the heels, raising the hips. The back angle should remain the same until the bar passes the knees. At that point, drive your hips through the bar as you lay back. Return the bar to the platform by reversing the motion.
91	Weighted pull-up	strength	lats	other	intermediate	Attach a weight to a dip belt and secure it around your waist. Grab the pull-up bar with the palms of your hands facing forward. For a medium grip, your hands should be spaced at shoulder width. Both arms should be extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip. You'll want to bring your torso back about 30 degrees while creating a curvature in your lower back and sticking your chest out. This will be your starting position. Now, exhale and pull your torso up until your head is above your hands. Concentrate on squeezing your shoulder blades back and down as you reach the top contracted position. After a brief moment at the top contracted position, inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position with your arms extended and your lats fully stretched.
92	Pullups	strength	lats	body_only	intermediate	Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar. After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates. The behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.
93	Rocky Pull-Ups/Pulldowns	strength	lats	other	beginner	Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using a wide grip. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar. After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Now repeat the same movements as described above except this time your torso will remain straight as you go up and the bar will touch the back of the neck instead of the upper chest. Tip: Use the head to lean forward slightly as it will help you properly execute this portion of the exercise. Once you have lowered yourself back down to the starting position, repeat the exercise for the prescribed amount of repetitions in your program.  Caution: The behind the neck variation can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck so this exercise is not recommended for people with shoulder problems. Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. You can also use a pull-down machine.
94	Close-grip pull-down	strength	lats	cable	intermediate	Sit down on a pull-down machine with a V-Bar attached to the top pulley. Adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar. Grab the V-bar with the palms facing each other (a neutral grip). Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly (around 30-degrees) in order to better engage the lats. This will be your starting position. Using your lats, pull the bar down as you squeeze your shoulder blades. Continue until your chest nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion. Tip: Keep the torso stationary throughout the movement. After a second hold on the contracted position, slowly bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe in. Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.  Caution: Avoid the temptation to use a weight so big that you need to start swinging your torso in order to perform the exercise.
95	Pull-up	strength	lats	body_only	beginner	Take a wide grip on a pull-up bar, hanging freely with your arms extended. This will be your starting position. Pull yourself up by flexing the elbows and adducting the glenohumeral joint. Do not swing or use momentum to complete the movement. Attempt to get your chin above your hands. Pause at the top of the motion before lowering yourself to the starting position.
96	Muscle Up	strength	lats	body_only	intermediate	Grip the rings using a false grip, with the base of your palms on top of the rings. Initiate a pull up by pulling the elbows down to your side, flexing the elbows. As you reach the top position of the pull-up, pull the rings to your armpits as you roll your shoulders forward, allowing your elbows to move straight back behind you. This puts you into the proper position to continue into the dip portion of the movement. Maintaining control and stability, extend through the elbow to complete the motion. Use care when lowering yourself to the ground.
97	Shotgun row	strength	lats	cable	intermediate	Attach a single handle to a low cable. After selecting the correct weight, stand a couple feet back with a wide-split stance. Your arm should be extended and your shoulder forward. This will be your starting position. Perform the movement by retracting the shoulder and flexing the elbow. As you pull, supinate the wrist, turning the palm upward as you go. After a brief pause, return to the starting position. <
98	Close-Grip Front Lat Pulldown	strength	lats	cable	intermediate	Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you - while holding the bar at the chosen grip width - bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary (only the arms should move). The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull the bar down using the forearms. After a second in the contracted position, while squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement. 6. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: The behind-the-neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.
99	V-bar pull-up	strength	lats	None	intermediate	Start by placing the middle of the V-bar in the middle of the pull-up bar (assuming that the pull-up station you are using does not have neutral grip handles). The V-Bar handles will be facing down so that you can hang from the pull-up bar through the use of the handles. Once you securely place the V-bar, take a hold of the bar from each side and hang from it. Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly in order to better engage the lats. This will be your starting position. Using your lats, pull your torso up while leaning your head back slightly so that you do not hit yourself with the chin-up bar. Continue until your chest nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion. After a second hold on the contracted position, slowly lower your body back to the starting position as you breathe in. Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.  Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a pull-up assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.  On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.
100	Rope climb	strength	lats	body_only	intermediate	Grab the rope with both hands above your head. Pull down on the rope as you take a small jump. Wrap the rope around one leg, using your feet to pinch the rope. Reach up as high as possible with your arms, gripping the rope tightly. Release the rope from your feet as you pull yourself up with your arms, bringing your knees towards your chest. Resecure your feet on the rope, and then stand up to take another high hold on the rope. Continue until you reach the top of the rope. To lower yourself, loosen the grip of your feet on the rope as you slide down using a hand over hand motion.
101	Atlas Stones	strongman	lower_back	other	intermediate	Begin with the atlas stone between your feet. Bend at the hips to wrap your arms vertically around the Atlas Stone, attempting to get your fingers underneath the stone. Many stones will have a small flat portion on the bottom, which will make the stone easier to hold. Pulling the stone into your torso, drive through the back half of your feet to pull the stone from the ground. As the stone passes the knees, lap it by sitting backward, pulling the stone on top of your thighs. Sit low, getting the stone high onto your chest as you change your grip to reach over the stone. Stand, driving through with your hips. Close distance to the loading platform, and lean back, extending the hips to get the stone as high as possible.
102	Barbell deficit deadlift	powerlifting	lower_back	barbell	beginner	Begin by having a platform or weight plates that you can stand on, usually 1-3 inches in height. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets. With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.
103	Back extension	strength	lower_back	body_only	intermediate	Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpads. Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction. With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: This exercise can also be performed without a hyperextension bench, but in this case you will need a spotter. Also, a similar exercise to this one is the good morning and the stiff-legged deadlift.
104	Axle Deadlift	strongman	lower_back	other	beginner	Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an over/under grip. With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.
105	Hyperextensions With No Hyperextension Bench	strength	lower_back	body_only	beginner	With someone holding down your legs, slide yourself down to the edge a flat bench until your hips hang off the end of the bench. Tip: Your entire upper body should be hanging down towards the floor. Also, you will be in the same position as if you were on a hyperextension bench but the range of motion will be shorter due to the height of the flat bench vs. that of the hyperextension bench. With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you almost touch the floor or you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings (whichever comes first). Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you exhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a hyperextension bench. Also, a similar exercise to this one is the good morning and the stiff-legged deadlift.
106	Deadlift with Bands	powerlifting	lower_back	barbell	beginner	To deadlift with short bands, simply loop them over the bar before you start, and step into them to set up. For long bands, they will need to be anchored to a secure base, such as heavy dumbbells or a rack. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Ensure that the bands are under the back half of your foot (for short bands), directly where you are driving into the floor. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets.2.  With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.
107	Deadlift with Chains	powerlifting	lower_back	barbell	beginner	You can attach the chains to the sleeves of the bar, or just drape the middle over the bar so there is a greater weight increase as you lift. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets. With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.
108	Rack Pull with Bands	powerlifting	lower_back	barbell	beginner	Set up in a power rack with the bar on the pins. The pins should be set to the desired point; just below the knees, just above, or in the mid thigh position. Attach bands to the base of the rack, or secure them with dumbbells. Attach the other end to the bar. You may need to choke the bands to provide tension. Position yourself against the bar in proper deadlifting position. Your feet should be under your hips, your grip shoulder width, back arched, and hips back to engage the hamstrings. Since the weight is typically heavy, you may use a mixed grip, a hook grip, or use straps to aid in holding the weight. With your head looking forward, extend through the hips and knees, pulling the weight up and back until lockout. Be sure to pull your shoulders back as you complete the movement. Return the weight to the pins and repeat.
109	Superman	stretching	lower_back	body_only	intermediate	To begin, lie straight and face down on the floor or exercise mat. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you. This is the starting position. Simultaneously raise your arms, legs, and chest off of the floor and hold this contraction for 2 seconds. Tip: Squeeze your lower back to get the best results from this exercise. Remember to exhale during this movement. Note: When holding the contracted position, you should look like superman when he is flying. Slowly begin to lower your arms, legs and chest back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed in your program.  Variations: You can also perform this exercise using one arm and leg at a time. Simply elevating your left leg, arm and side of your chest and do the same with the right side.
110	T-Bar Row with Handle	strength	middle_back	other	intermediate	Position a bar into a landmine or in a corner to keep it from moving. Load an appropriate weight onto your end. Stand over the bar, and position a Double D row handle around the bar next to the collar. Using your hips and legs, rise to a standing position. Assume a wide stance with your hips back and your chest up. Your arms should be extended. This will be your starting position. Pull the weight to your upper abdomen by retracting the shoulder blades and flexing the elbows. Do not jerk the weight or cheat during the movement. After a brief pause, return to the starting position.
111	Reverse-grip bent-over row	strength	middle_back	barbell	intermediate	Stand erect while holding a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up). Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second. Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution:  This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.  Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a pronated (palms facing out) grip or using dumbbells.
112	One-Arm Dumbbell Row	strength	middle_back	dumbbell	intermediate	Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it. Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support. Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms. Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions. Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.  Variations: One-arm rows can also be performed using a high pulley or a low pulley instead of a dumbbell.
113	One-Arm Long Bar Row	strength	middle_back	barbell	intermediate	Position a bar into a landmine or in a corner to keep it from moving. Load an appropriate weight onto your end. Stand next to the bar, and take a grip with one hand close to the collar. Using your hips and legs, rise to a standing position. Assume a bent-knee stance with your hips back and your chest up. Your arm should be extended. This will be your starting position. Pull the weight to your side by retracting the shoulder and flexing the elbow. Do not jerk the weight or cheat during the movement. After a brief pause, return to the starting position.
114	T-Bar Row	strength	middle_back	other	intermediate	Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. Stand astride the bar and bend at the hips to take a pronated grip on the handles. Ensure that your back remains flat, and then remove the weight from the rests, letting the bar hang at arms length. This will be your starting position. Perform the movement by flexing the elbows and retracting the shoulder blades, pulling the weight to your chest. After a brief pause at the top of the motion, return to the starting position.
115	Bent Over Two-Arm Long Bar Row	strength	middle_back	barbell	intermediate	Put weight on one of the ends of an Olympic barbell. Make sure that you either place the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward. Bend forward until your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees slightly bent. Now grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee. This will be your starting position. Pull the bar straight up with your elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end of the bar. Slowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones). Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley or T-bar row machine.
116	Alternating sit-through with crunch	strength	middle_back	other	intermediate	Put weight on one of the ends of an Olympic barbell. Make sure that you either place the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward. Bend forward until your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees slightly bent. Now grab the bar with one arm just behind the plates on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee. This will be your starting position. Pull the bar straight up with your elbow in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Do not allow for any swinging of the torso. Only the arm should move. Slowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones). Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and switch arms.  Variations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley.
117	Rower	cardio	middle_back	machine	intermediate	To begin, seat yourself on the rower. Make sure that your heels are resting comfortably against the base of the foot pedals and that the straps are secured. Select the program that you wish to use, if applicable. Sit up straight and bend forward at the hips. There are three phases of movement when using a rower. The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles. The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase.
118	Seated Cable Rows	strength	middle_back	cable	intermediate	For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles. With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so. Variations: You can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip).
119	Incline dumbbell row	strength	middle_back	dumbbell	intermediate	Using a neutral grip, lean into an incline bench. Take a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip, beginning with the arms straight. This will be your starting position. Retract the shoulder blades and flex the elbows to row the dumbbells to your side. Pause at the top of the motion, and then return to the starting position.
120	Lying Face Down Plate Neck Resistance	strength	neck	other	beginner	Lie face down with your whole body straight on a flat bench while holding a weight plate behind your head. Tip: You will need to position yourself so that your shoulders are slightly above the end of a flat bench in order for the upper chest, neck and face to be off the bench. This will be your starting position. While keeping the plate secure on the back of your head slowly lower your head (as in saying yes) as you breathe in. Raise your head back up to the starting position in a semi-circular motion as you breathe out. Hold the contraction for a second. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: As with all exercises, refrain from using any sort of sudden or jerking motions. Variation: You can opt to use no resistance at first.
121	Lying Face Up Plate Neck Resistance	strength	neck	other	beginner	Lie face up with your whole body straight on a flat bench while holding a weight plate on top of your forehead. Tip: You will need to position yourself so that your shoulders are slightly above the end of a flat bench in order for the traps, neck and head to be off the bench. This will be your starting position. While keeping the plate secure on your forehead slowly lower your head back in a semi-circular motion as you breathe in. Raise your head back up to the starting position in a semi-circular motion as you breathe out. Hold the contraction for a second. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: As with all exercises, refrain from using any sort of sudden or jerking motions. Variation: You can opt to use no resistance at first.
122	Seated Head Harness Neck Resistance	strength	neck	other	beginner	Place a neck strap on the floor at the end of a flat bench. Once you have selected the weights, sit at the end of the flat bench with your feet wider than shoulder width apart from each other. Your toes should be pointed out. Slowly move your torso forward until it is almost parallel with the floor. Using both hands, securely position the neck strap around your head. Tip: Make sure the weights are still lying on the floor to prevent any strain on the neck. Now grab the weight with both hands while elevating your torso back until it is almost perpendicular to the floor. Note: Your head and torso needs to be slightly tilted forward to perform this exercise. Now place both hands on top of your knees. This is the starting position. Slowly lower your neck down until your chin touches the upper part of your chest while breathing in. While exhaling, bring your neck back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: This exercise puts a lot of stress on the neck muscles and should be approached with caution. Any sudden jerk or movement can cause you to strain a neck muscle. It is best to practice the form at first without any weights to get used to the movements required for this exercise.
123	Isometric Neck Exercise - Sides	strength	neck	body_only	beginner	With your head and neck in a neutral position (normal position with head erect facing forward), place your left hand on the left side of your head. Now gently push towards the left as you contract the left neck muscles but resisting any movement of your head. Start with slow tension and increase slowly. Keep breathing normally as you execute this contraction. Hold for the recommended number of seconds. Now release the tension slowly. Rest for the recommended amount of time and repeat with your right hand placed on the right side of your head.  Variations: You can also do this exercise by placing your hands to the front and then to the back of your head. First do one side and then the next.
124	Isometric Neck Exercise - Front And Back	strength	neck	body_only	beginner	With your head and neck in a neutral position (normal position with head erect facing forward), place both of your hands on the front side of your head. Now gently push forward as you contract the neck muscles but resisting any movement of your head. Start with slow tension and increase slowly. Keep breathing normally as you execute this contraction. Hold for the recommended number of seconds. Now release the tension slowly. Rest for the recommended amount of time and repeat with your hands placed on the back side of your head.  Variations: You can also do this exercise by placing your hands on the sides of your head. First do one side and then the next.
125	Neck Bridge Prone	strength	neck	body_only	beginner	Begin in a prone position on the floor, on your hands and knees. Place your head next to your hands but a few inches nearer your legs, then extend your legs, driving your hips into the air. Transition into supporting your weight on your head by removing your hands from the ground. Perform this movement slowly, backing off if any serious discomfort is felt and avoiding it if you have any pre-existing neck injury. Hold the neck bridge for a period of time, and then carefully return your hands and knees to the floor.
126	Side Neck Stretch	stretching	neck	body_only	intermediate	Start with your shoulders relaxed, gently tilt your head towards your shoulder. Assist stretch with a gentle pull on the side of the head.
127	Chin To Chest Stretch	stretching	neck	None	intermediate	Get into a seated position on the floor. Place both hands at the rear of your head, fingers interlocked, thumbs pointing down and elbows pointing straight ahead. Slowly pull your head down to your chest. Hold for 20-30 seconds.
128	Neck-SMR	stretching	neck	body_only	intermediate	Using a muscle roller or a rolling pin, place the roller behind your head and against your neck. Make sure that you do not place the roller directly against the spine, but turned slightly so that the roller is pressed against the muscles to either side of the spine. This will be your starting position. Starting at the top of your neck, slowly roll down the muscles of your neck, pausing at points of tension for 10-30 seconds.
129	Single-Leg Press	strength	quadriceps	machine	intermediate	Load the sled to an appropriate weight. Seat yourself on the machine, planting one foot on the platform in line with your hip. Your free foot can be placed on the ground. Maintain good spinal position with your head and chest up. Supporting the weight, fully extend the knee and unlock the sled. This will be your starting position. Lower the weight by flexing the hip and knee, continuing as far as flexibility allows. Do not allow your lumbar to take the load by moving your pelvis. At the bottom of the motion pause briefly and then return to the starting position by extending the hip and knee. Complete all repetitions for one leg before switching to the other.
130	Clean from Blocks	olympic_weightlifting	quadriceps	barbell	beginner	With a barbell on boxes or stands of the desired height, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position. Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight with the elbows pointed out. Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.3.  As full extension is achieved, transition into the receiving position by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. Aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. Return the weight to the boxes for the next rep.
131	Barbell Full Squat	strength	quadriceps	barbell	intermediate	This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just above shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting back with your hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  This type of squat allows a greater range of motion, and allows the trunk to maintain a more vertical position than other types of squats, due to foot position and the higher bar position.
132	Tire flip	strongman	quadriceps	other	intermediate	Begin by gripping the bottom of the tire on the tread, and position your feet back a bit. Your chest should be driving into the tire. To lift the tire, extend through the hips, knees, and ankles, driving into the tire and up. As the tire reaches a 45 degree angle, step forward and drive a knee into the tire. As you do so adjust your grip to the upper portion of the tire and push it forward as hard as possible to complete the turn. Repeat as necessary.
133	Barbell back squat to box	powerlifting	quadriceps	barbell	intermediate	The box squat allows you to squat to desired depth and develop explosive strength in the squat movement. Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box. Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe.
134	Push-press	olympic_weightlifting	quadriceps	barbell	intermediate	Beginning Position:  Use the floor-to-shoulder lifting technique described in the Power Clean exercise to move the bar from the floor to the shoulders.  Upward Movement Phase:  Slightly flex the hips and knees, keeping torso erect. Immediately follow with an explosive push upward by extending the knees. Keep torso erect and tensed. At maximum hip and knee extension, shift body weight to balls of feet and extend ankle joints. At maximum plantar flexion, push bar from the shoulders. Push the bar with the arms to a fully extended elbow position overhead.  Downward Movement Phase:  Lower bar to shoulders. Flex hips and knees slightly as bar touches shoulders. Straighten the hips and knees before the upward movement phase begins again.  Breathing:  Exhale through the sticking point of the upward movement phase. Inhale during the downward movement phase.
135	Power snatch-	olympic_weightlifting	quadriceps	barbell	expert	Place your feet at a shoulder width stance with the barbell resting right above the connection between the toes and the rest of the foot. With a palms facing down grip, bend at the knees and keeping the back flat grab the bar using a wider than shoulder width grip. Bring the hips down and make sure that your body drops as if you were going to sit on a chair. This will be your starting position. Start pushing the floor as if it were a moving platform with your feet and simultaneously start lifting the barbell keeping it close to your legs. As the bar reaches the middle of your thighs, push the floor with your legs and lift your body to a complete extension in an explosive motion. Lift your shoulders back in a shrugging movement as you bring the bar up while lifting your elbows out to the side and keeping them above the bar for as long as possible. Now in a very quick but powerful motion, you have to get your body under the barbell when it has reached a high enough point where it can be controlled and drop while locking your arms and holding the barbell overhead as you assume a squat position. Finalize the movement by rising up out of the squat position to finish the lift. At the end of the lift both feet should be on line and the arms fully extended holding the barbell overhead.  Caution: This is a very advanced exercise so be extremely careful with the weight used. Bad form on this exercise can lead to serious injury.
136	Hang Clean	olympic_weightlifting	quadriceps	barbell	beginner	Begin with a shoulder width, double overhand or hook grip, with the bar hanging at the mid thigh position. Your back should be straight and inclined slightly forward. Begin by aggressively extending through the hips, knees and ankles, driving the weight upward. As you do so, shrug your shoulders towards your ears. As full extension is achieved, transition into the final pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.3.  Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.
145	Barbell shrug	strength	traps	barbell	intermediate	Stand up straight with your feet at shoulder width as you hold a barbell with both hands in front of you using a pronated grip (palms facing the thighs). Tip: Your hands should be a little wider than shoulder width apart. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for a better grip. This will be your starting position. Raise your shoulders up as far as you can go as you breathe out and hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Refrain from trying to lift the barbell by using your biceps. Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also rotate your shoulders as you go up, going in a semicircular motion from front to rear. However this version is not good for people with shoulder problems. In addition, this exercise can be performed with the barbell behind the back, with dumbbells by the side, a smith machine or with a shrug machine.
137	Reverse Band Box Squat	powerlifting	quadriceps	None	intermediate	Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Set up the bands either on band pegs or attached to the top of the rack, ensuring they will be directly above the bar during the squat. Attach the other end to the bar. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box. Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe. Use care to return the barbell to the rack.
138	Jumping rope	cardio	quadriceps	body_only	intermediate	Hold an end of the rope in each hand. Position the rope behind you on the ground. Raise your arms up and turn the rope over your head bringing it down in front of you. When it reaches the ground, jump over it. Find a good turning pace that can be maintained. Different speeds and techniques can be used to introduce variation. Rope jumping is exciting, challenges your coordination, and requires a lot of energy. A 150 lb person will burn about 350 calories jumping rope for 30 minutes, compared to over 450 calories running.
139	Smith machine shrug	strength	traps	machine	intermediate	To begin, set the bar height on the smith machine around the middle of your thighs. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grab the bar using a pronated grip (palms facing you) shoulder width apart from each other. Lift the barbell up and fully extend your arms with your back straight. This is the starting position. While exhaling, elevate the bar by raising your shoulders until they come close to touching your ears. Hold the contraction for a second before lowering the bar back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can be performed using a squat rack with a barbell. However, be careful not to select a weight that is so heavy that it causes you to break good form as you do not have the support of the smith machine for this variation. Too much weight can harm your back. You can also use dumbbells to perform this exercise.
140	Leverage Shrug	strength	traps	machine	intermediate	Load the pins to an appropriate weight. Position yourself directly between the handles. Grasp the top handles with a comfortable grip, and then lower your hips as you take a breath. Look forward with your head and keep your chest up. Drive through the floor with your heels, extending your hips and knees as you rise to a standing position. Keep your arms straight throughout the movement, finishing with your shoulders back. This will be your starting position. Raise the weight by shrugging the shoulders towards your ears, moving straight up and down. Pause at the top of the motion, and then return the weight to the starting position.
141	Standing dumbbell shrug	strength	traps	dumbbell	intermediate	Stand erect with a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing your torso), arms extended on the sides. Lift the dumbbells by elevating the shoulders as high as possible while you exhale. Hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: The arms should remain extended at all times. Refrain from using the biceps to help lift the dumbbells. Only the shoulders should be moving up and down. Lower the dumbbells back to the original position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can perform this exercise with bands, barbells or cables. You can also use a single handle and work one side at a time.
142	Standing dumbbell upright row	strength	traps	dumbbell	intermediate	Grasp a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated (palms forward) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The dumbbells should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position. Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be close to the body as you move it up and the elbows should drive the motion. Continue to lift them until they nearly touch your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbells, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement. Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises. Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar.
143	Kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull	strength	traps	kettlebells	intermediate	Place a kettlebell on the ground between your feet. Position your feet in a wide stance, and grasp the kettlebell with two hands. Set your hips back as far as possible, with your knees bent. Keep your chest and head up. This will be your starting position. Begin by extending the hips and knees, simultaneously pulling the kettlebell to your shoulders, raising your elbows as you do so. Reverse the motion to return to the starting position.
144	Calf-Machine Shoulder Shrug	strength	traps	machine	beginner	Position yourself on the calf machine so that the shoulder pads are above your shoulders. Your torso should be straight with the arms extended normally by your side. This will be your starting position. Raise your shoulders up towards your ears as you exhale and hold the contraction for a full second. Slowly return to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can use dumbbells, barbells, smith machines and pulley machines to perform shrugging motions.
146	Barbell behind-the-back shrug	strength	traps	barbell	intermediate	Stand up straight with your feet at shoulder width as you hold a barbell with both hands behind your back using a pronated grip (palms facing back). Tip: Your hands should be a little wider than shoulder width apart. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for better grip. This will be your starting position. Raise your shoulders up as far as you can go as you breathe out and hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Refrain from trying to lift the barbell by using your biceps. The arms should remain stretched out at all times. Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also rotate your shoulders as you go up, going in a semicircular motion from rear to front. However this version is not good for people with shoulder problems. In addition, this exercise can be performed with the barbell in front of your thighs, with dumbbells by the side, a smith machine or with a shrug machine.
147	Triceps dip	strength	triceps	body_only	intermediate	To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm's length with your arms nearly locked above the bars. Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm. Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.
148	Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher	strength	triceps	e-z_curl_bar	intermediate	Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench. Using a close grip (a grip that is slightly less than shoulder width), lift the EZ bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked and elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack. As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary, bring the bar down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until you feel the bar slightly touch your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Lift the bar back to the starting position by contracting the triceps and exhaling. Repeat until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed.  Variations: You can use a straight bar or dumbbells to perform this movement. You can also perform it on a flat bench as well.
149	Dumbbell floor press	powerlifting	triceps	dumbbell	intermediate	Lay on the floor holding dumbbells in your hands. Your knees can be bent. Begin with the weights fully extended above you. Lower the weights until your upper arm comes in contact with the floor. You can tuck your elbows to emphasize triceps size and strength, or to focus on your chest angle your arms to the side. Pause at the bottom, and then bring the weight together at the top by extending through the elbows.
150	Cable V-bar push-down	strength	triceps	cable	intermediate	Attach a V-Bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width. Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. The thumbs should be higher than the small finger. This is your starting position. Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After a second hold at the contracted position, bring the V-Bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a straight cable bar attachment for different variations of the exercise. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises. Just like the Triceps Pushdown but with the V-Bar attachment.
151	Weighted bench dip	strength	triceps	body_only	intermediate	For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back and another one in front of you. With the benches perpendicular to your body, hold on to one bench on its edge with the hands close to your body, separated at shoulder width. Your arms should be fully extended. The legs will be extended forward on top of the other bench. Your legs should be parallel to the floor while your torso is to be perpendicular to the floor. Have your partner place the dumbbell on your lap. Note: This exercise is best performed with a partner as placing the weight on your lap can be challenging and cause injury without assistance. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down. Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position while exhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: By placing your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you, the exercise becomes more challenging. It is best to attempt this exercise without any weights at first in order to get used to the movements required for good form. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement.
152	EZ-Bar Skullcrusher	strength	triceps	e-z_curl_bar	intermediate	Using a close grip, lift the EZ bar and hold it with your elbows in as you lie on the bench. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Keeping the upper arms stationary, lower the bar by allowing the elbows to flex. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Pause once the bar is directly above the forehead. Lift the bar back to the starting position by extending the elbow and exhaling. Repeat.
153	Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown	strength	triceps	cable	intermediate	Start by setting a bar attachment (straight or e-z) on a high pulley machine. Facing the bar attachment, grab it with the palms facing up (supinated grip) at shoulder width. Lower the bar by using your lats until your arms are fully extended by your sides. Tip: Elbows should be in by your sides and your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position. Slowly elevate the bar attachment up as you inhale so it is aligned with your chest. Only the forearms should move and the elbows/upper arms should be stationary by your side at all times. Then begin to lower the cable bar back down to the original staring position while exhaling and contracting the triceps hard. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: This exercise can also be performed with a single handle using one arm at a time. This will allow you to better isolate the triceps. With this version you can self spot yourself by placing your hand over your forearm and applying some pressure to help you perform more reps than before.
154	Push-Ups - Close Triceps Position	strength	triceps	body_only	intermediate	Lie on the floor face down and place your hands closer than shoulder width for a close hand position. Make sure that you are holding your torso up at arms' length. Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Using your triceps and some of your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest. Breathe out as you perform this step. After a second pause at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations:  If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor. For the most advanced lifters, you can place your feet at a high surface such as a bench in order to increase the resistance.  See Also: Push-Up
155	Kneeling cable triceps extension	strength	triceps	cable	intermediate	Place a bench sideways in front of a high pulley machine. Hold a straight bar attachment above your head with your hands about 6 inches apart with your palms facing down. Face away from the machine and kneel. Place your head and the back of your upper arms on the bench. Your elbows should be bent with the forearms pointing towards the high pulley. This will be your starting position. While keeping your upper arms close to your head at all times with the elbows in, press the bar out in a semicircular motion until the elbows are locked and your arms are parallel to the floor. Contract the triceps hard and keep this position for a second. Exhale as you perform this movement. Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: You can also perform this exercise with exercise bands.
156	Single-arm cable triceps extension	strength	triceps	cable	intermediate	With your right hand, grasp a single handle attached to the high-cable pulley using a supinated (underhand; palms facing up) grip. You should be standing directly in front of the weight stack. Now pull the handle down so that your upper arm and elbow are locked in to the side of your body. Your upper arm and forearm should form an acute angle (less than 90-degrees). You can keep the other arm by the waist and you can have one leg in front of you and the other one back for better balance. This will be your starting position. As you contract the triceps, move the single handle attachment down to your side until your arm is straight. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Your upper arms should remain stationary at all times. Squeeze the triceps and hold for a second in this contracted position. Slowly return the handle to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the other arm.  Variations: You can use exercise bands to perform this exercise.
